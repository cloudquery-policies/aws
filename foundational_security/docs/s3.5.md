## \[S3\.5\] S3 buckets should require requests to use Secure Socket Layer

**Category:** Protect > Secure access management

**Severity:** Medium

**Resource type:** `AWS::S3::Bucket`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-bucket-ssl-requests-only.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-bucket-ssl-requests-only.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether S3 buckets have policies that require requests to use Secure Socket Layer \(SSL\)\. 

S3 buckets should have policies that require all requests \(`Action: S3:*`\) to only accept transmission of data over HTTPS in the S3 resource policy, indicated by the condition key `aws:SecureTransport`\.

### Remediation<a name="s3-5-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, update the permissions policy of the S3 bucket\.

**To configure an S3 bucket to deny nonsecure transport**

1. Open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. Navigate to the noncompliant bucket, then choose the bucket name\.

1. Choose **Permissions**, and then choose **Bucket Policy**\.

1. Add a similar policy statement to that in the policy below\. Replace `awsexamplebucket` with the name of the bucket you are modifying\.

   ```
   {
       "Id": "ExamplePolicy",
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "AllowSSLRequestsOnly",
               "Action": "s3:*",
               "Effect": "Deny",
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:s3:::awsexamplebucket",
                   "arn:aws:s3:::awsexamplebucket/*"
               ],
               "Condition": {
                   "Bool": {
                        "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
                   }
               },
              "Principal": "*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

1. Choose **Save**\.
