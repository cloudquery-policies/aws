## \[ACM\.1\] Imported ACM certificates should be renewed after a specified time period<a name="fsbp-acm-1"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Data protection > Encryption of data in transit

**Severity:** Medium

**Resource type:** `AWS::ACM::Certificate`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/acm-certificate-expiration-check.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/acm-certificate-expiration-check.html)

**Parameters:**
+ `daysToExpiration`: 30

This control checks whether ACM certificates in your account are marked for expiration within 30 days\. It checks both imported certificates and certificates provided by AWS Certificate Manager\.

ACM can automatically renew certificates that use DNS validation\. For certificates that use email validation, you must respond to a domain validation email\. ACM also does not automatically renew certificates that you import\. You must renew imported certificates manually\.

For more information about managed renewal for ACM certificates, see [Managed renewal for ACM certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/managed-renewal.html) in the *AWS Certificate Manager User Guide*\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in the following Regions\.  
Africa \(Cape Town\) 
China \(Beijing\)

### Remediation<a name="acm-1-remediation"></a>

ACM provides managed renewal for your Amazon\-issued SSL/TLS certificates\. This means that ACM either renews your certificates automatically \(if you use DNS validation\), or it sends you email notices when the certificate expiration approaches\. These services are provided for both public and private ACM certificates\.

**For domains validated by email**  
When a certificate is 45 days from expiration, ACM sends to the domain owner an email for each domain name\. To validate the domains and complete the renewal, you must respond to the email notifications\.  
For more information, see [Renewal for domains validated by email](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/email-renewal-validation.html) in the *AWS Certificate Manager User Guide*\.

**For domains validated by DNS**  
ACM automatically renews certificates that use DNS validation\. 60 days before the expiration, ACM verifies that the certificate can be renewed\.  
If it cannot validate a domain name, then ACM sends a notification that manual validation is required\. It sends these notifications 45 days, 30 days, 7 days, and 1 day before the expiration\.  
For more information, see [Renewal for domains validated by DNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/dns-renewal-validation.html) in the *AWS Certificate Manager User Guide*\.

**Parameters:**
+ `readWriteType`: `ALL`

This control checks that there is at least one multi\-Region CloudTrail trail\.

AWS CloudTrail records AWS API calls for your account and delivers log files to you\. The recorded information includes the following information\.
+ Identity of the API caller
+ Time of the API call
+ Source IP address of the API caller
+ Request parameters
+ Response elements returned by the AWS service

CloudTrail provides a history of AWS API calls for an account, including API calls made from the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools\. The history also includes API calls from higher\-level AWS services such as AWS CloudFormation\.

The AWS API call history produced by CloudTrail enables security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing\. Multi\-Region trails also provide the following benefits\.
+ A multi\-Region trail helps to detect unexpected activity occurring in otherwise unused Regions\.
+ A multi\-Region trail ensures that global service event logging is enabled for a trail by default\. Global service event logging records events generated by AWS global services\.
+ For a multi\-Region trail, management events for all read and write operations ensure that CloudTrail records management operations on all of an AWS account’s resources\.

By default, CloudTrail trails that are created using the AWS Management Console are multi\-Region trails\.

### Remediation<a name="cloudtrail-1-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, create a new multi\-Region trail in CloudTrail\.

## \[CloudTrail\.5\] Ensure CloudTrail trails are integrated with Amazon CloudWatch Logs<a name="fsbp-cloudtrail-5"></a>

**Category:** Identify > Logging

**Severity:** Low

**Resource type:** `AWS::CloudTrail::Trail`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/cloud-trail-cloud-watch-logs-enabled.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/cloud-trail-cloud-watch-logs-enabled.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether CloudTrail trails are configured to send logs to CloudWatch Logs\. The control fails if the `CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn` property of the trail is empty\.

CloudTrail records AWS API calls that are made in a given account\. The recorded information includes the following:
+ The identity of the API caller
+ The time of the API call
+ The source IP address of the API caller
+ The request parameters
+ The response elements returned by the AWS service

CloudTrail uses Amazon S3 for log file storage and delivery\. You can capture CloudTrail logs in a specified S3 bucket for long\-term analysis\. To perform real\-time analysis, you can configure CloudTrail to send logs to CloudWatch Logs\.

For a trail that is enabled in all Regions in an account, CloudTrail sends log files from all of those Regions to a CloudWatch Logs log group\.

Security Hub recommends that you send CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs\. Note that this recommendation is intended to ensure that account activity is captured, monitored, and has appropriately alarms\. You can use CloudWatch Logs to set this up with your AWS services\. This recommendation does not preclude the use of a different solution\.

Sending CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs facilitates real\-time and historic activity logging based on user, API, resource, and IP address\. You can use this approach to establish alarms and notifications for anomalous or sensitivity account activity\.

### Remediation<a name="cloudtrail-5-remediation"></a>

You can use the console to enable CloudTrail integration with CloudWatch Logs\.

**To enable CloudTrail integration with CloudWatch Logs**

1. Open the CloudTrail console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudtrail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/)\.

1. Choose **Trails**\.

1. Choose the trail that does not have a value for **CloudWatch Logs Log group**\.

1. Under **CloudWatch Logs**, choose **Edit**\.

1. Select **Enabled**\.

1. For **Log group**, do one of the following:
   + To use the default log group, keep the name as is\.
   + To use an existing log group, choose **Existing** and then enter the name of the log group to use\.
   + To create a new log group, choose **New** and then enter a name for the log group to create\.

1. For **IAM role**, do one of the following:
   + To use an existing role, choose **Existing** and then choose the role from the drop\-down list\.
   + To create a new role, choose **New** and then enter a name for the role to create\. The new role is assigned a policy that grants the necessary permissions\.

   To view the permissions granted to the role, expand **Policy document**\.

1. Choose **Save changes**\.

## \[Config\.1\] AWS Config should be enabled<a name="fsbp-config-1"></a>

**Category:** Identify > Inventory

**Severity:** Medium

**Resource type:** AWS account

**AWS Config rule:** None

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether AWS Config is enabled in the account for the local Region and is recording all resources\.

The AWS Config service performs configuration management of supported AWS resources in your account and delivers log files to you\. The recorded information includes the configuration item \(AWS resource\), relationships between configuration items, and any configuration changes between resources\. 

Security Hub recommends that you enable AWS Config in all Regions\. The AWS configuration item history that AWS Config captures enables security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing\. 

**Note**  
Because Security Hub is a Regional service, the check performed for this control checks only the current Region for the account\. It does not check all Regions\.   
To allow security checks against global resources in each Region, you also must record global resources\. If you only record global resources in a single Region, then you can disable this control in all Regions except the Region where you record global resources\.

To learn more, see [Getting started with AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html) in the *AWS Config Developer Guide*\.

### Remediation<a name="config-1-remediation"></a>

After you enable AWS Config, configure it to record all resources\.

**To configure AWS Config settings**

1. Open the AWS Config console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/config/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/config/)\.

1. Choose the Region to configure AWS Config in\.

1. If you have not used AWS Config before, choose **Get started**\.

1. On the **Settings** page, do the following:

   1. Under **Resource types to record**, choose **Record all resources supported in this region** and **Include global resources \(e\.g\. AWS IAM resources\)**\. 

   1. Under **AWS Config role**, either choose **Create AWS Config service\-linked role** or **Choose a role from your account** and then choose the role to use\.

   1. Under **Amazon S3 bucket**, specify the bucket to use or create a bucket and optionally include a prefix\. 

   1. Under **Amazon SNS topic**, choose an Amazon SNS topic from your account or create one\. For more information about Amazon SNS, see the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/gsg/](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/gsg/)\. 

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. On the **AWS Config rules** page, choose **Next**\. 

1. Choose **Confirm**\.

For more information about using AWS Config from the AWS CLI, see [Turning on AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/gs-cli-subscribe.html) in the *AWS Config Developer Guide*\. 

You can also use an AWS CloudFormation template to automate this process\. For more information, see the [AWS CloudFormation StackSets sample template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-sampletemplates.html) in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide*\. 

## \[DMS\.1\] AWS Database Migration Service replication instances should not be public<a name="fsbp-dms-1"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Secure network configuration

**Severity:** Critical

**Resource type:** `AWS::DMS::ReplicationInstance`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/dms-replication-not-public.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/dms-replication-not-public.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether AWS DMS replication instances are public\. To do this, it examines the value of the `PubliclyAccessible` field\.

A private replication instance has a private IP address that you cannot access outside of the replication network\. A replication instance should have a private IP address when the source and target databases are in the same network\. The network must also be connected to the replication instance's VPC using a VPN, AWS Direct Connect, or VPC peering\. To learn more about public and private replication instances, see [Public and private replication instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_ReplicationInstance.html#CHAP_ReplicationInstance.PublicPrivate) in the *AWS Database Migration Service User Guide*\.

You should also ensure that access to your AWS DMS instance configuration is limited to only authorized users\. To do this, restrict users’ IAM permissions to modify AWS DMS settings and resources\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in Africa \(Cape Town\) or Europe \(Milan\)\.

### Remediation<a name="dms-1-remediation"></a>

Note that you cannot change the public access setting once a replication instance is created\. It must be deleted and recreated\.

**To configure the AWS DMS replication instances setting to block public access**

1. Open the AWS Database Migration Service console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/dms/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dms/)\.

1. Navigate to** Replication instances**, then delete the public instance\. Choose the instance, choose **Actions**, then choose **delete**\.

1. Choose **Create replication instance**\. Provide the configuration details\.

1. To disable public access, make sure that **Publicly accessible** is not selected\.

1. Choose **Create**\.

For more information, see the section on [Creating a replication instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_ReplicationInstance.html#CHAP_ReplicationInstance.Creating) in the *AWS Database Migration Service User Guide*\.

## \[DynamoDB\.1\] DynamoDB tables should automatically scale capacity with demand<a name="fsbp-dynamodb-1"></a>

**Category:** Recover > Resilience > High availability

**Severity:** Medium

**Resource type:** `AWS::DynamoDB::Table`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/dynamodb-autoscaling-enabled.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/dynamodb-autoscaling-enabled.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether an Amazon DynamoDB table can scale its read and write capacity as needed\. This control passes if the table uses either on\-demand capacity mode or provisioned mode with auto scaling configured\. Scaling capacity with demand avoids throttling exceptions, which helps to maintain availability of your applications\.

DynamoDB tables in on\-demand capacity mode are only limited by the DynamoDB throughput default table quotas\. To raise these quotas, you can file a support ticket through [AWS Support](http://aws.amazon.com/support)\.

DynamoDB tables in provisioned mode with auto scaling adjust the provisioned throughput capacity dynamically in response to traffic patterns\. For additional information on DynamoDB request throttling, see [Request throttling and burst capacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ProvisionedThroughput.html#ProvisionedThroughput.Throttling) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in AWS GovCloud \(US\-East\) or AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\)\.

### Remediation<a name="dynamodb-1-remediation"></a>

For detailed instructions on enabling DynamoDB automatic scaling on existing tables in capacity mode, see [Enabling DynamoDB auto scaling on existing tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/AutoScaling.Console.html#AutoScaling.Console.ExistingTable) in the*Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*\.

## \[DynamoDB\.2\] DynamoDB tables should have point\-in\-time recovery enabled<a name="fsbp-dynamodb-2"></a>

**Category:** Recover > Resilience > Backups enabled

**Severity:** Medium

**Resource type:** `AWS::DynamoDB::Table`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/dynamodb-pitr-enabled.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/dynamodb-pitr-enabled.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether point\-in\-time recovery \(PITR\) is enabled for an Amazon DynamoDB table\.

Backups help you to recover more quickly from a security incident\. They also strengthen the resilience of your systems\. DynamoDB point\-in\-time recovery automates backups for DynamoDB tables\. It reduces the time to recover from accidental delete or write operations\. DynamoDB tables that have PITR enabled can be restored to any point in time in the last 35 days\.

### Remediation<a name="dynamodb-2-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, add point\-in\-time recovery to your DynamoDB table\.

**To enable DynamoDB point\-in\-time recovery for an existing table**

1. Open the DynamoDB console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/dynamodb/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)\.

1. Choose the table that you want to work with, and then choose **Backups**\. 

1. In the **Point\-in\-time Recovery** section, under **Status**, choose **Enable**\.

1. Choose **Enable** again to confirm the change\.

## \[DynamoDB\.3\] DynamoDB Accelerator \(DAX\) clusters should be encrypted at rest<a name="fsbp-dynamodb-3"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Data protection > Encryption of data at rest 

**Severity:** Medium

**Resource type:** `AWS::DAX::Cluster`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/dax-encryption-enabled.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/dax-encryption-enabled.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether a DAX cluster is encrypted at rest\. 

Encrypting data at rest reduces the risk of data stored on disk being accessed by a user not authenticated to AWS\. The encryption adds another set of access controls to limit the ability of unauthorized users to access to the data\. For example, API permissions are required to decrypt the data before it can be read\.

### Remediation<a name="dynamodb-3-remediation"></a>

You cannot enable or disable encryption at rest after a cluster is created\. You must recreate the cluster in order to enable encryption at rest\. For detailed instructions on how to create a DAX cluster with encryption at rest enabled, see[ Enabling encryption at rest using the AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DAXEncryptionAtRest.html#dax.encryption.tutorial-console) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*\.

## \[EC2\.1\] Amazon EBS snapshots should not be public, determined by the ability to be restorable by anyone<a name="fsbp-ec2-1"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Secure network configuration

**Severity:** Critical 

**Resource type:** AWS account

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ebs-snapshot-public-restorable-check.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ebs-snapshot-public-restorable-check.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks that Amazon Elastic Block Store snapshots are not public, as determined by the ability to be restorable by anyone\.

EBS snapshots are used to back up the data on your EBS volumes to Amazon S3 at a specific point in time\. You can use the snapshots to restore previous states of EBS volumes\. It is rarely acceptable to share a snapshot with the public\. Typically the decision to share a snapshot publicly was made in error or without a complete understanding of the implications\. This check helps ensure that all such sharing was fully planned and intentional\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in Africa \(Cape Town\) or Europe \(Milan\)\.

### Remediation<a name="ec2-1-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, update your EBS snapshot to make it private instead of public\.

**To make a public EBS snapshot private**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, under **Elastic Block Store**, choose **Snapshots** menu and then choose your public snapshot\.

1. From **Actions**, choose **Modify permissions**\.

1. Choose **Private**\.

1. \(Optional\) Add the AWS account numbers of the authorized accounts to share your snapshot with and choose **Add Permission**\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

## \[EC2\.2\] The VPC default security group should not allow inbound and outbound traffic<a name="fsbp-ec2-2"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Secure network configuration

**Severity:** High 

**Resource type:** `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/vpc-default-security-group-closed.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/vpc-default-security-group-closed.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks that the default security group of a VPC does not allow inbound or outbound traffic\.

The rules for the [default security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#DefaultSecurityGroup) allow all outbound and inbound traffic from network interfaces \(and their associated instances\) that are assigned to the same security group\.

We do not recommend using the default security group\. Because the default security group cannot be deleted, you should change the default security group rules setting to restrict inbound and outbound traffic\. This prevents unintended traffic if the default security group is accidentally configured for resources such as EC2 instances\.

### Remediation<a name="ec2-2-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, create new security groups and assign those security groups to your resources\. To prevent the default security groups from being used, remove their inbound and outbound rules\.

**To create new security groups and assign them to your resources**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Security groups**\. View the default security groups details to see the resources that are assigned to them\.

1. Create a set of least\-privilege security groups for the resources\. For details on how to create security groups, see [Creating a security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#CreatingSecurityGroups) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. On the Amazon EC2 console, change the security group for the resources that use the default security groups to the least\-privilege security group you created\. See [Changing an instance's security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#SG_Changing_Group_Membership) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

After you assign the new security groups to the resources, remove the inbound and outbound rules from the default security groups\. This ensures that the default security groups are not used\.

**To remove the rules from the default security group**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Security groups**\.

1. Select a default security group and choose the **Inbound rules** tab\. Choose **Edit inbound rules**\. Then delete all inbound rules\. Choose **Save rules**\.

1. Repeat the previous step for each default security group\.

1. Select a default security group and choose the **Outbound rule** tab\. Choose **Edit outbound rules**\. Then delete all outbound rules\. Choose **Save rules**\.

1. Repeat the previous step for each default security group\.

For more information, see [Working with security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#WorkingWithSecurityGroups) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

## \[EC2\.3\] Attached EBS volumes should be encrypted at rest<a name="fsbp-ec2-3"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Data protection > Encryption of data at rest

**Severity:** Medium

**Resource type:** `AWS::EC2::Volume`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/encrypted-volumes.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/encrypted-volumes.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether the EBS volumes that are in an attached state are encrypted\. To pass this check, EBS volumes must be in use and encrypted\. If the EBS volume is not attached, then it is not subject to this check\.

For an added layer of security of your sensitive data in EBS volumes, you should enable EBS encryption at rest\. Amazon EBS encryption offers a straightforward encryption solution for your EBS resources that doesn't require you to build, maintain, and secure your own key management infrastructure\. It uses KMS keys when creating encrypted volumes and snapshots\.

To learn more about Amazon EBS encryption, see [Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in Africa \(Cape Town\) or Europe \(Milan\)\.

### Remediation<a name="ec2-3-remediation"></a>

There is no direct way to encrypt an existing unencrypted volume or snapshot\. You can only encrypt a new volume or snapshot when you create it\.

If you enabled encryption by default, Amazon EBS encrypts the resulting new volume or snapshot using your default key for Amazon EBS encryption\. Even if you have not enabled encryption by default, you can enable encryption when you create an individual volume or snapshot\. In both cases, you can override the default key for Amazon EBS encryption and choose a symmetric customer managed key\.

For more information, see [Creating an Amazon EBS volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-volume.html) and [Copying an Amazon EBS snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-copy-snapshot.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

## \[EC2\.4\] Stopped EC2 instances should be removed after a specified time period<a name="fsbp-ec2-4"></a>

**Category:** Identify > Inventory

**Severity:** Medium

**Resource type:** `AWS::EC2::Instance`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ec2-stopped-instance.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ec2-stopped-instance.html)

**Parameters:**
+ `allowedDays`: 30

This control checks whether any EC2 instances have been stopped for more than the allowed number of days\. An EC2 instance fails this check if it is stopped for longer than the maximum allowed time period, which by default is 30 days\.

A failed finding indicates that an EC2 instance has not run for a significant period of time\. This creates a security risk because the EC2 instance is not being actively maintained \(analyzed, patched, updated\)\. If it is later launched, the lack of proper maintenance could result in unexpected issues in your AWS environment\. To safely maintain an EC2 instance over time in a nonrunning state, start it periodically for maintenance and then stop it after maintenance\. Ideally this is an automated process\. 

**Note**  
This control is not supported in Africa \(Cape Town\) or Europe \(Milan\)\.

### Remediation<a name="ec2-4-remediation"></a>

You can terminate an EC2 instance using either the console or the command line\.

Before you terminate the EC2 instance, verify that you won't lose any data:
+ Check that your Amazon EBS volumes will not be deleted on termination\.
+ Copy any data that you need from your EC2 instance store volumes to Amazon EBS or Amazon S3\. 

**To terminate an EC2 instance \(console\)**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, under **Instances**, choose **Instances**\.

1. Select the instance, and then choose **Actions**, **Instance State**, **Terminate**\. 

1. When prompted for confirmation, choose **Yes, Terminate**\. 

**To terminate an EC2 instance \(AWS CLI, Tools for Windows PowerShell\)**  
Use one of the following commands\. For more information about the command line interface, see [Accessing Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html#access-ec2) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.
+ From the AWS CLI, use [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/terminate-instances.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/terminate-instances.html)
+ From the Tools for Windows PowerShell, use [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Stop-EC2Instance.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Stop-EC2Instance.html)\.

To learn more about terminating instances, see [Terminating an instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html#terminating-instances-console) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

## \[EC2\.6\] VPC flow logging should be enabled in all VPCs<a name="fsbp-ec2-6"></a>

**Category:** Identify > Logging

**Severity:** Medium

**Resource type:** `AWS::EC2::VPC`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/vpc-flow-logs-enabled.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/vpc-flow-logs-enabled.html)

**Parameters:**
+ `trafficType`: `REJECT`

This control checks whether Amazon VPC Flow Logs are found and enabled for VPCs\. The traffic type is set to `Reject`\. 

With the VPC Flow Logs feature, you can capture information about the IP address traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC\. After you create a flow log, you can view and retrieve its data in CloudWatch Logs\. To reduce cost, you can also send your flow logs to Amazon S3\. 

Security Hub recommends that you enable flow logging for packet rejects for VPCs\. Flow logs provide visibility into network traffic that traverses the VPC and can detect anomalous traffic or provide insight during security workflows\. 

By default, the record includes values for the different components of the IP address flow, including the source, destination, and protocol\. For more information and descriptions of the log fields, see [VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

### Remediation<a name="ec2-6-remediation"></a>

## \[EC2\.7\] EBS default encryption should be enabled<a name="fsbp-ec2-7"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Data protection > Encryption of data at rest 

**Severity:** Medium

**Resource type:** AWS account

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ec2-ebs-encryption-by-default.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ec2-ebs-encryption-by-default.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether account\-level encryption is enabled by default for Amazon Elastic Block Store\(Amazon EBS\)\. The control fails if the account level encryption is not enabled\. 

When encryption is enabled for your account, Amazon EBS volumes and snapshot copies are encrypted at rest\. This adds an additional layer of protection for your data\. For more information, see [Encryption by default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-by-default) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

Note that following instance types do not support encryption: R1, C1, and M1\.

## \[EC2\.8\] EC2 instances should use IMDSv2<a name="fsbp-ec2-8"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Network security

**Severity:** High

**Resource type:** `AWS::EC2::Instance`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ec2-imdsv2-check.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ec2-imdsv2-check.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether your EC2 instance metadata version is configured with Instance Metadata Service Version 2 \(IMDSv2\)\. The control passes if `HttpTokens` is set to required for IMDSv2\. The control fails if `HttpTokens` is set to `optional`\.

You use instance metadata to configure or manage the running instance\. The IMDS provides access to temporary, frequently rotated credentials\. These credentials remove the need to hard code or distribute sensitive credentials to instances manually or programmatically\. The IMDS is attached locally to every EC2 instance\. It runs on a special "link local" IP address of 169\.254\.169\.254\. This IP address is only accessible by software that runs on the instance\.

Version 2 of the IMDS adds new protections for the following types of vulnerabilities\. These vulnerabilities could be used to try to access the IMDS\.
+ Open website application firewalls
+ Open reverse proxies
+ Server\-side request forgery \(SSRF\) vulnerabilities
+ Open Layer 3 firewalls and network address translation \(NAT\)

Security Hub recommends that you configure your EC2 instances with IMDSv2\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in Africa \(Cape Town\) or Europe \(Milan\)\.

### Remediation<a name="ec2-8-remediation"></a>

To remediate an EC2 instance that is not configured with IMDSv2, you can require the use of IMDSv2\.

To require IMDSv2 on an existing instance, when you request instance metadata, modify the Amazon EC2 metadata options\. Follow the instructions in [Configuring instance metadata options for existing instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

To require the use of IMDSv2 on a new instance when you launch it, follow the instructions in [Configuring instance metadata options for new instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

**To configure your new EC2 instance with IMDSv2 from the console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. Choose **Launch instance** and then choose **Launch instance**\.

1. In the **Configure Instance Details** step, under **Advanced Details**, for **Metadata version**, choose **V2 \(token required\)**\.

1. Choose **Review and Launch**\.

If your software uses IMDSv1, you can reconfigure your software to use IMDSv2\. For details, see [Transitioning to using Instance Metadata Service Version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html#instance-metadata-transition-to-version-2) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

## \[EC2\.9\] EC2 instances should not have a public IP address<a name="fsbp-ec2-9"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Secure network configuration > Public IP addresses

**Severity:** High

**Resource type:** `AWS::EC2::Instance`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ec2-instance-no-public-ip.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ec2-instance-no-public-ip.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether EC2 instances have a public IP address\. The control fails if the `publicIp` field is present in the EC2 instance configuration item\. This control applies to IPv4 addresses only\. 

A public IPv4 address is an IP address that is reachable from the internet\. If you launch your instance with a public IP address, then your EC2 instance is reachable from the internet\. A private IPv4 address is an IP address that is not reachable from the internet\. You can use private IPv4 addresses for communication between EC2 instances in the same VPC or in your connected private network\.

IPv6 addresses are globally unique, and therefore are reachable from the internet\. However, by default all subnets have the IPv6 addressing attribute set to false\. For more information about IPv6, see [IP addressing in your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-ip-addressing.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

If you have a legitimate use case to maintain EC2 instances with public IP addresses, then you can suppress the findings from this control\. For more information about front\-end architecture options, see the [AWS Architecture Blog](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/) or the [This Is My Architecture series](http://aws.amazon.com/this-is-my-architecture/?tma.sort-by=item.additionalFields.airDate&tma.sort-order=desc&awsf.category=categories%23mobile)\.

### Remediation<a name="ec2-9-remediation"></a>

Use a non\-default VPC so that your instance is not assigned a public IP address by default\.

When you launch an EC2 instance into a default VPC, it is assigned a public IP address\. When you launch an EC2 instance into a non\-default VPC, the subnet configuration determines whether it receives a public IP address\. The subnet has an attribute to determine if new EC2 instances in the subnet receive a public IP address from the public IPv4 address pool\.

You cannot manually associate or disassociate an automatically\-assigned public IP address from your EC2 instance\. To control whether your EC2 instance receives a public IP address, do one of the following:
+ Modify the public IP addressing attribute of your subnet\. For more information, see [Modifying the public IPv4 addressing attribute for your subnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-ip-addressing.html#subnet-public-ip) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\. 
+ Enable or disable the public IP addressing feature during launch\. This overrides the subnet's public IP addressing attribute\. For more information, see[ Assign a public IPv4 address during instance launch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#public-ip-addresses) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

For more information, see [Public IPv4 addresses and external DNS hostnames](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

If your EC2 instance is associated with an Elastic IP address, then your EC2 instance is reachable from the internet\. You can disassociate an Elastic IP address from an instance or network interface at any time\.

**To disassociate an Elastic IP address**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Elastic IPs**\.

1. Select the Elastic IP address to disassociate\.

1. From **Actions**, choose **Disassociate Elastic IP address**\.

1. Choose **Disassociate**\.

## \[EC2\.10\] Amazon EC2 should be configured to use VPC endpoints that are created for the Amazon EC2 service<a name="fsbp-ec2-10"></a>

**Category:** Protect \- Secure network configuration > API private access

**Severity:** Medium

**Resource type:** `AWS::EC2::VPC`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/service-vpc-endpoint-enabled.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/service-vpc-endpoint-enabled.html)

**Parameters:** 
+ `serviceName`: `ec2`

This control checks whether a service endpoint for Amazon EC2 is created for each VPC\. The control fails if a VPC does not have a VPC endpoint created for the Amazon EC2 service\. 

To improve the security posture of your VPC, you can configure Amazon EC2 to use an interface VPC endpoint\. Interface endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a technology that enables you to access Amazon EC2 API operations privately\. It restricts all network traffic between your VPC and Amazon EC2 to the Amazon network\. Because endpoints are supported within the same Region only, you cannot create an endpoint between a VPC and a service in a different Region\. This prevents unintended Amazon EC2 API calls to other Regions\. 

To learn more about creating VPC endpoints for Amazon EC2, see [Amazon EC2 and interface VPC endpoints ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/interface-vpc-endpoints.html)in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

### Remediation<a name="ec2-10-remediation"></a>

   1. For **VPC**, select a VPC in which to create the endpoint\. 

   1. For **Subnets**, select the subnets \(Availability Zones\) in which to create the endpoint network interfaces\. Not all Availability Zones are supported for all AWS services\. 

   1. To enable private DNS for the interface endpoint, select the check box for **Enable DNS Name**\. This option is enabled by default\.

      To use the private DNS option, the following attributes of your VPC must be set to true:
      + `enableDnsHostnames`
      + `enableDnsSupport`

      For more information, see [Viewing and updating DNS support for your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#vpc-dns-updating) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\. 

   1. For **Security group**, select the security groups to associate with the endpoint network interfaces\. 

   1. \(Optional\) Add or remove a tag\. To add a tag, choose **Add tag** and do the following: 
      + For **Key**, enter the tag name\. 
      + For **Value**, enter the tag value\.

   1. To remove a tag, choose the delete button \(**x**\) to the right of the tag **Key** and **Value**\. 

1. Choose **Create endpoint**\.

**To create an interface VPC endpoint policy**

You can attach a policy to your VPC endpoint to control access to the Amazon EC2 API\. The policy specifies the following:

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether the assignment of public IPs in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\) subnets have `MapPublicIpOnLaunch` set to `FALSE`\. The control passes if the flag is set to `FALSE`\. 

All subnets have an attribute that determines whether a network interface created in the subnet automatically receives a public IPv4 address\. Instances that are launched into subnets that have this attribute enabled have a public IP address assigned to their primary network interface\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in the following Regions:  
Asia Pacific \(Osaka\)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether there are any unused network access control lists \(ACLs\)\.

The control checks the item configuration of the resource `AWS::EC2::NetworkAcl` and determines the relationships of the network ACL\.

If the only relationship is the VPC of the network ACL, then the control fails\.

If other relationships are listed, then the control passes\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in the following Regions:

**Parameters:**
+ `Adapterids` \(Optional\) – A list of network interface IDs that are attached to EC2 instances

This control checks whether an EC2 instance uses multiple Elastic Network Interfaces \(ENIs\) or Elastic Fabric Adapters \(EFAs\)\. This control passes if a single network adapter is used\. The control includes an optional parameter list to identify the allowed ENIs\.

Multiple ENIs can cause dual\-homed instances, meaning instances that have multiple subnets\. This can add network security complexity and introduce unintended network paths and access\.

This control also fails if an Amazon EKS cluster that belongs to an Amazon EKS cluster has more than one ENI\. If you need to use EC2 instances that have multiple ENIs as part of an Amazon EKS cluster, you can suppress those findings\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in the following Regions:  
Asia Pacific \(Osaka\)
AWS GovCloud \(US\-East\)
AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\)

### Remediation<a name="ec2-17-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, detach the additional ENIs\.

**To detach a network interface**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. Under **Network & Security**, choose **Network Interfaces**\.

1. Filter the list by the noncompliant instance IDs to see the associated ENIs\.

**Resource type:** `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/vpc-sg-open-only-to-authorized-ports.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/vpc-sg-open-only-to-authorized-ports.html)

**Parameters:**
+ `authorizedTcpPorts` \(Optional\) – Comma\-separated list of ports to which to allow unrestricted access\. For example: `'80, 443'`\. For this rule, the default values for `authorizedTcpPorts` are 80 and 443\.

This control checks whether the security groups that are in use allow unrestricted incoming traffic\. Optionally the rule checks whether the port numbers are listed in the `authorizedTcpPorts` parameter\.
+ If the security group rule port number allows unrestricted incoming traffic, but the port number is specified in `authorizedTcpPorts`, then the control passes\. The default value for `authorizedTcpPorts` is `80, 443`\.
+ If the security group rule port number allows unrestricted incoming traffic, but the port number is not specified in `authorizedTcpPorts` input parameter, then the control fails\.
+ If the parameter is not used, then the control fails for any security group that has an unrestricted inbound rule\.

Security groups provide stateful filtering of ingress and egress network traffic to AWS\. Security group rules should follow the principal of least privileged access\. Unrestricted access \(IP address with a /0 suffix\) increases the opportunity for malicious activity such as hacking, denial\-of\-service attacks, and loss of data\.

Unless a port is specifically allowed, the port should deny unrestricted access\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in Asia Pacific \(Osaka\)\.

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether master nodes on Amazon EMR clusters have public IP addresses\. 

The control fails if the master node has public IP addresses that are associated with any of its instances\. Public IP addresses are designated in the `PublicIp` field of the `NetworkInterfaces` configuration for the instance\. This control only checks Amazon EMR clusters that are in a `RUNNING` or `WAITING` state\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in Africa \(Cape Town\) or Europe \(Milan\)\.

### Remediation<a name="emr-1-remediation"></a>

During launch, you can control whether your instance in a default or nondefault subnet is assigned a public IPv4 address\.

By default, default subnets have this attribute set to `true`\. Nondefault subnets have the IPv4 public addressing attribute set to `false`, unless it was created by the Amazon EC2 launch instance wizard\. In that case, the wizard sets the attribute to `true`\.

You need to launch your cluster in a VPC with a private subnet that has the IPv4 public addressing attribute set to `false`\. 

After launch, you cannot manually disassociate a public IPv4 address from your instance\.

To remediate this finding, you need to create a new cluster in VPC private subnet\. For information on how to launch a cluster in into a VPC private subnet, see [Launch clusters into a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-vpc-launching-job-flows.html) in the *Amazon EMR Management Guide*\.

## \[ES\.1\] Elasticsearch domains should have encryption at rest enabled<a name="fsbp-es-1"></a>

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/elasticsearch-encrypted-at-rest.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/elasticsearch-encrypted-at-rest.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether Elasticsearch domains have encryption at rest configuration enabled\. The check fails if encryption at rest is not enabled\.

For an added layer of security for your sensitive data in OpenSearch, you should configure your OpenSearch to be encrypted at rest\. Elasticsearch domains offer encryption of data at rest\. The feature uses AWS KMS to store and manage your encryption keys\. To perform the encryption, it uses the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm with 256\-bit keys \(AES\-256\)\.

To learn more about OpenSearch encryption at rest, see [Encryption of data at rest for Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/encryption-at-rest.html) in the *Amazon OpenSearch Service Developer Guide*\.

**Note**  
Certain instance types, such as `t.small` and `t.medium`, do not support encryption of data at rest\. For details, see [Supported instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/supported-instance-types.html) in the *Amazon OpenSearch Service Developer Guide*\.

### Remediation<a name="es-1-remediation"></a>

By default, domains do not encrypt data at rest, and you cannot configure existing domains to use the feature\.

To enable the feature, you must create another domain and migrate your data\. For information about creating domains, see the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/createupdatedomains.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/createupdatedomains.html)\.

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/elasticsearch-in-vpc-only.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/elasticsearch-in-vpc-only.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether Elasticsearch domains are in a VPC\. It does not evaluate the VPC subnet routing configuration to determine public access\. You should ensure that Elasticsearch domains are not attached to public subnets\. See [Resource\-based policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/ac.html#ac-types-resource) in the *Amazon OpenSearch Service Developer Guide*\. You should also ensure that your VPC is configured according to the recommended best practices\. See [Security best practices for your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-best-practices.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

Elasticsearch domains deployed within a VPC can communicate with VPC resources over the private AWS network, without the need to traverse the public internet\. This configuration increases the security posture by limiting access to the data in transit\. VPCs provide a number of network controls to secure access to Elasticsearch domains, including network ACL and security groups\. Security Hub recommends that you migrate public Elasticsearch domains to VPCs to take advantage of these controls\.

### Remediation<a name="es-2-remediation"></a>

If you create a domain with a public endpoint, you cannot later place it within a VPC\. Instead, you must create a new domain and migrate your data\. The reverse is also true\. If you create a domain within a VPC, it cannot have a public endpoint\. Instead, you must either [create another domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/createupdatedomains.html) or disable this control\.

This control checks whether connections to Elasticsearch domains are required to use TLS 1\.2\. The check fails if the Elasticsearch domain `TLSSecurityPolicy` is not Policy\-Min\-TLS\-1\-2\-2019\-07\.

HTTPS \(TLS\) can be used to help prevent potential attackers from using person\-in\-the\-middle or similar attacks to eavesdrop on or manipulate network traffic\. Only encrypted connections over HTTPS \(TLS\) should be allowed\. Encrypting data in transit can affect performance\. You should test your application with this feature to understand the performance profile and the impact of TLS\. TLS 1\.2 provides several security enhancements over previous versions of TLS\.

### Remediation<a name="es-8-remediation"></a>

To enable TLS encryption, use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/configuration-api.html#configuration-api-actions-updatedomainconfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/configuration-api.html#configuration-api-actions-updatedomainconfig) API operation to configure the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/configuration-api.html#configuration-api-datatypes-domainendpointoptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/configuration-api.html#configuration-api-datatypes-domainendpointoptions) in order to set the `TLSSecurityPolicy`\.

## \[GuardDuty\.1\] GuardDuty should be enabled<a name="fsbp-guardduty-1"></a>

**Category:** Detect > Detection services 

**Severity:** High

**Resource type:** AWS account

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/guardduty-enabled-centralized.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/guardduty-enabled-centralized.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether Amazon GuardDuty is enabled in your GuardDuty account and Region\.

It is highly recommended that you enable GuardDuty in all supported AWS Regions\. Doing so allows GuardDuty to generate findings about unauthorized or unusual activity, even in Regions that you do not actively use\. This also allows GuardDuty to monitor CloudTrail events for global AWS services such as IAM\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in the following Regions\.  
Africa \(Cape Town\)
China \(Beijing\)
China \(Ningxia\)
Europe \(Milan\)
Middle East \(Bahrain\)
 AWS GovCloud \(US\-East\)

### Remediation<a name="guardduty-1-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, you enable GuardDuty\.

For details on how to enable GuardDuty, including how to use AWS Organizations to manage multiple accounts, see [Getting started with GuardDuty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_settingup.html) in the *Amazon GuardDuty User Guide*\.

## \[IAM\.1\] IAM policies should not allow full "\*" administrative privileges<a name="fsbp-iam-1"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Secure access management

**Severity:** High

**Resource type:** `AWS::IAM::Policy`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-policy-no-statements-with-admin-access.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-policy-no-statements-with-admin-access.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether the default version of IAM policies \(also known as customer managed policies\) has administrator access that includes a statement with "Effect": "Allow" with "Action": "\*" over "Resource": "\*"\.

The control only checks the customer managed policies that you create\. It does not check inline and AWS managed policies\.

IAM policies define a set of privileges that are granted to users, groups, or roles\. Following standard security advice, AWS recommends that you grant least privilege, which means to grant only the permissions that are required to perform a task\. When you provide full administrative privileges instead of the minimum set of permissions that the user needs, you expose the resources to potentially unwanted actions\.

Instead of allowing full administrative privileges, determine what users need to do and then craft policies that let the users perform only those tasks\. It is more secure to start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary\. Do not start with permissions that are too lenient and then try to tighten them later\.

You should remove IAM policies that have a statement with `"Effect": "Allow" `with `"Action": "*"` over `"Resource": "*"`\.

### Remediation<a name="iam-1-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, update your IAM policies so that they do not allow full "\*" administrative privileges\.

**To modify an IAM policy**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. Choose **Policies**\.

1. Choose the button next to the policy to remove\.

1. From **Policy actions**, choose **Detach**\.

1. For each user to detach the policy from, choose the button next to the user, then choose **Detach policy**\.

Confirm that the user that you detached the policy from can still access AWS services and resources as expected\.

## \[IAM\.2\] IAM users should not have IAM policies attached<a name="fsbp-iam-2"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Secure access management

**Severity:** Low

**Resource type:** `AWS::IAM::User`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-user-no-policies-check.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-user-no-policies-check.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks that none of your IAM users have policies attached\. Instead, IAM users must inherit permissions from IAM groups or roles\.

By default, IAM users, groups, and roles have no access to AWS resources\. IAM policies grant privileges to users, groups, or roles\. We recommend that you apply IAM policies directly to groups and roles but not to users\. Assigning privileges at the group or role level reduces the complexity of access management as the number of users grows\. Reducing access management complexity might in turn reduce the opportunity for a principal to inadvertently receive or retain excessive privileges\. 

Note that this control also generates failed findings for IAM users that are created by Amazon Simple Email Service \(Amazon SES\)\. Amazon SES generates users that have inline policies attached\. You can suppress these findings\.

### Remediation<a name="iam-2-remediation"></a>

To resolve this issue, create an IAM group, assign the policy to the group, and then add the users to the group\. The policy is applied to each user in the group\.

**To create an IAM group**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. Choose **Groups** and then choose **Create New Group**\.

1. Enter a name for the group to create and then choose **Next Step**\.

1. Select each policy to assign to the group and then choose **Next Step**\. The policies that you choose should include any policies currently attached directly to a user account\.

1. Add users to a group and then assign the policies to that group\. Each user in the group is then assigned the policies that are assigned to the group\.

1. Confirm the details on the **Review** page and then choose **Create Group**\.

For more information about creating groups, see [Creating IAM groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups_create.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

**To add users to an IAM group**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. Choose **Groups**\.

1. Choose **Group Actions** and then choose **Add Users to Group**\.

1. Select the users to add to the group and then choose **Add Users**\.

For more information about adding users to groups, see [Adding and removing users in an IAM group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups_manage_add-remove-users.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

**To remove a policy attached directly to a user**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. Choose **Users**\.

1. For the user to detach a policy from, choose the name in the **User name** column\.

1. For each policy listed under **Attached directly**, choose the **X** on the right side of the page to remove the policy from the user and then choose **Remove**\.

1. Confirm that the user can still use AWS services as expected\.

## \[IAM\.3\] IAM users' access keys should be rotated every 90 days or less<a name="fsbp-iam-3"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Secure access management

**Severity:** Medium 

**Resource type:** `AWS::IAM::User`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/access-keys-rotated.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/access-keys-rotated.html)

**Parameters:**
+ `maxAccessKeyAge`: 90

This control checks whether the active access keys are rotated within 90 days\.

We highly recommend that you do not generate and remove all access keys in your account\. Instead, the recommended best practice is to either create one or more IAM roles or to use [federation](http://aws.amazon.com/identity/federation/)\. You can use these methods to allow your users to use their existing corporate credentials to log into the AWS Management Console and AWS CLI\.

Each approach has its use cases\. Federation is generally better for enterprises that have an existing central directory or plan to need more than the current limit IAM users\. Applications that run outside of an AWS environment need access keys for programmatic access to AWS resources\.

However, if the resources that need programmatic access run inside AWS, the best practice is to use IAM roles\. Roles allow you to grant a resource access without hardcoding an access key ID and secret access key into the configuration\.

To learn more about protecting your access keys and account, see [Best practices for managing AWS access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\. Also see the blog post [Guidelines for protecting your AWS account while using programmatic access](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/guidelines-for-protecting-your-aws-account-while-using-programmatic-access/)\.

If you already have an access key, Security Hub recommends that you rotate the access keys every 90 days\. Rotating access keys reduces the chance that an access key that is associated with a compromised or terminated account is used\. It also ensures that data cannot be accessed with an old key that might have been lost, cracked, or stolen\. Always update your applications after you rotate access keys\. 

Access keys consist of an access key ID and a secret access key\. They are used to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS\. AWS users need their own access keys to make programmatic calls to AWS from the AWS CLI, Tools for Windows PowerShell, the AWS SDKs, or direct HTTP calls using the API operations for individual AWS services\.

If your organization uses AWS Single Sign\-On \(AWS SSO\), your users can sign in to Active Directory, a built\-in AWS SSO directory, or [another identity provider \(IdP\) connected to AWS SSO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/manage-your-identity-source-idp.html)\. They can then be mapped to an IAM role that enables them to run AWS CLI commands or call AWS API operations without the need for IAM user access keys\. To learn more, see [Configuring the AWS CLI to use AWS Single Sign\-On](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in Africa \(Cape Town\) or Europe \(Milan\)\.

### Remediation<a name="iam-3-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, replace any keys that are older than 90 days\.

**To ensure that access keys aren't more than 90 days old**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. Choose **Users**\.

1. For each user that shows an **Access key age** that is greater than 90 days, choose the **User name** to open the settings for that user\.

1. Choose **Security credentials**\.

1. Create a new key for the user:

   1. Choose **Create access key**\.

   1. To save the key content, either download the secret access key, or choose **Show** and then copy it from the page\.

   1. Store the key in a secure location to provide to the user\.

   1. Choose **Close**\.

1. Update all applications that were using the previous key to use the new key\.

1. For the previous key, choose **Make inactive** to make the access key inactive\. The user now cannot use that key to make requests\.

1. Confirm that all applications work as expected with the new key\.

1. After confirming that all applications work with the new key, delete the previous key\. After you delete the access key, you cannot recover it\.

   To delete the previous key, choose the **X** at the end of the row and then choose **Delete**\.

## \[IAM\.4\] IAM root user access key should not exist<a name="fsbp-iam-4"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Secure access management

**Severity:** Critical 

**Resource type:** AWS account

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-root-access-key-check.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-root-access-key-check.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether the root user access key is present\. 

The root account is the most privileged user in an AWS account\. AWS access keys provide programmatic access to a given account\.

Security Hub recommends that you remove all access keys that are associated with the root account\. This limits that vectors that can be used to compromise the account\. It also encourages the creation and use of role\-based accounts that are least privileged\. 

**Note**  
This control is not supported in Africa \(Cape Town\)\.

### Remediation<a name="iam-4-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, delete the root user access key\.

**To delete access keys**

1. Log in to your account using the AWS account root user credentials\.

1. Choose the account name near the top\-right corner of the page and then choose **My Security Credentials**\.

1. In the pop\-up warning, choose **Continue to Security Credentials**\. 

1. Choose **Access keys \(access key ID and secret access key\)**\. 

1. To permanently delete the key, choose **Delete** and then choose **Yes**\. You cannot recover deleted keys\.

1. If there is more than one root user access key, then repeat steps 4 and 5 for each key\.

## \[IAM\.5\] MFA should be enabled for all IAM users that have a console password<a name="fsbp-iam-5"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Secure access management

**Severity:** Medium

**Resource type:** `AWS::IAM::User`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/mfa-enabled-for-iam-console-access.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/mfa-enabled-for-iam-console-access.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether AWS multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) is enabled for all IAM users that use a console password\.

Multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) adds an extra layer of protection on top of a user name and password\. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS website, they are prompted for their user name and password\. In addition, they are prompted for an authentication code from their AWS MFA device\.

We recommend that you enable MFA for all accounts that have a console password\. MFA is designed to provide increased security for console access\. The authenticating principal must possess a device that emits a time\-sensitive key and must have knowledge of a credential\. 

### Remediation<a name="iam-5-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, add MFA to users that do not yet have it\. 

**To configure MFA for a user**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. Choose **Users**\.

1. Choose the **User name** of the user to configure MFA for\.

1. Choose **Security credentials**\.

1. Next to **Assigned MFA Device**, choose **Manage**\.

1. Follow the **Manage MFA Device** wizard to assign the type of device appropriate for your environment\. 

To learn how to delegate MFA setup to users, see the blog post [How to delegate management of multi\-factor authentication to AWS IAM users](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-delegate-management-of-multi-factor-authentication-to-aws-iam-users/)\.

## \[IAM\.6\] Hardware MFA should be enabled for the root user<a name="fsbp-iam-6"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Secure access management

**Severity:** Critical

**Resource type:** AWS account

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/root-account-hardware-mfa-enabled.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/root-account-hardware-mfa-enabled.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether your AWS account is enabled to use a hardware multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) device to sign in with root user credentials\.

Virtual MFA might not provide the same level of security as hardware MFA devices\. We recommend that you use only a virtual MFA device while you wait for hardware purchase approval or for your hardware to arrive\. To learn more, see[ Enabling a virtual multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) device \(console\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_virtual.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in the following Regions\.  
China \(Beijing\)
China \(Ningxia\)
AWS GovCloud \(US\-East\)
AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\)\.

### Remediation<a name="iam-6-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, add hardware\-based MFA to the root account\.

**To enable hardware\-based MFA for the root account**

1. Log in to your account using the root user credentials\.

1. Choose the account name near the top\-right corner of the page and then choose **My Security Credentials**\.

1. In the pop\-up warning, choose **Continue to Security Credentials**\.

1. Choose **Multi\-Factor Authentication \(MFA\)**\.

1. Choose **Activate MFA**\.

1. Choose a hardware\-based \(not virtual\) device to use for MFA and then choose **Continue**\.

1. Complete the steps to configure the device type appropriate to your selection\.

## \[IAM\.7\] Password policies for IAM users should have strong configurations<a name="fsbp-iam-7"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Secure access management

**Severity:** Medium

**Resource type:** AWS account

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-password-policy.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-password-policy.html)

**Parameters:**
+ `RequireUppercaseCharacters`: `true`
+ `RequireLowercaseCharacters`: `true`
+ `RequireSymbols`: `true`
+ `RequireNumbers`: `true`
+ `MinimumPasswordLength`: `8`

This control checks whether the account password policy for IAM users uses the following recommended configurations\.
+ `RequireUppercaseCharacters`: `true`
+ `RequireLowercaseCharacters`: `true`
+ `RequireSymbols`: `true`
+ `RequireNumbers`: `true`
+ `MinimumPasswordLength`: `8`

To access the AWS Management Console, IAM users need passwords\. As a best practice, Security Hub highly recommends that instead of creating IAM users, you use federation\. Federation allows users to use their existing corporate credentials to log into the AWS Management Console\. Use AWS Single Sign\-On \(AWS SSO\) to create or federate the user, and then assume an IAM role into an account\.

To learn more about identity providers and federation, see [Identity providers and federation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\. To learn more about AWS SSO, see the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html)\.

 If you need to use IAM users, Security Hub recommends that you enforce the creation of strong user passwords\. You can set a password policy on your AWS account to specify complexity requirements and mandatory rotation periods for passwords\. When you create or change a password policy, most of the password policy settings are enforced the next time users change their passwords\. Some of the settings are enforced immediately\. To learn more, see [Setting an account password policy for IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_passwords_account-policy.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

### Remediation<a name="iam-7-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, update your password policy to use the recommended configuration\.

**To modify the password policy**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. Choose **Account settings**\.

1. Select **Requires at least one uppercase letter**\.

1. Select **Requires at least one lowercase letter**\.

1. Select **Requires at least one non\-alphanumeric character**\.

1. Select **Requires at least one number**\.

1. For **Minimum password length**, enter **8**\.

1. Choose **Apply password policy**\.

## \[IAM\.8\] Unused IAM user credentials should be removed<a name="fsbp-iam-8"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Secure access management 

**Severity:** Medium 

**Resource type:** `AWS::IAM::User`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-user-unused-credentials-check.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-user-unused-credentials-check.html)

**Parameters:**
+ `maxCredentialUsageAge`: 90 

This control checks whether your IAM users have passwords or active access keys that have not been used for 90 days\.

IAM users can access AWS resources using different types of credentials, such as passwords or access keys\. 

Security Hub recommends that you remove or deactivate all credentials that were unused for 90 days or more\. Disabling or removing unnecessary credentials reduces the window of opportunity for credentials associated with a compromised or abandoned account to be used\.

### Remediation<a name="iam-8-remediation"></a>

To get some of the information that you need to monitor accounts for dated credentials, use the IAM console\. For example, when you view users in your account, there is a column for **Access key age**, **Password age**, and **Last activity**\. If the value in any of these columns is greater than 90 days, make the credentials for those users inactive\.

You can also use credential reports to monitor user accounts and identify those with no activity for 90 or more days\. You can download credential reports in `.csv` format from the IAM console\. For more information about credential reports, see [Getting credential reports for your AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_getting-report.html#getting-credential-reports-console) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

After you identify the inactive accounts or unused credentials, use the following steps to disable them\.

**To disable credentials for inactive accounts**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. Choose **Users**\.

1. Choose the name of the user that has credentials over 90 days old\.

1. Choose** Security credentials**\.

1. For each sign\-in credential and access key that hasn't been used in at least 90 days, choose **Make inactive**\.

## \[IAM\.21\] IAM customer managed policies that you create should not allow wildcard actions for services<a name="fsbp-iam-21"></a>

**Category:** Detect > Secure access management 

**Severity:** Low

**Resource type:** `AWS::IAM::Policy`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-policy-no-statements-with-full-access.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-policy-no-statements-with-full-access.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether the IAM identity\-based policies that you create have Allow statements that use the \* wildcard to grant permissions for all actions on any service\. The control fails if any policy statement includes `"Effect": "Allow"` with `"Action": "Service:*"`\. 

For example, the following statement in a policy results in a failed finding\.

```
"Statement": [
{
  "Sid": "EC2-Wildcard",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "ec2:*",
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

The control also fails if you use `"Effect": "Allow"` with `"NotAction": "service:*"`\. In that case, the `NotAction` element provides access to all of the actions in an AWS service, except for the actions specified in `NotAction`\.

This control only applies to customer managed IAM policies\. It does not apply to IAM policies that are managed by AWS\.

When you assign permissions to AWS services, it is important to scope the allowed IAM actions in your IAM policies\. You should restrict IAM actions to only those actions that are needed\. This helps you to provision least privilege permissions\. Overly permissive policies might lead to privilege escalation if the policies are attached to an IAM principal that might not require the permission\.

In some cases, you might want to allow IAM actions that have a similar prefix, such as `DescribeFlowLogs` and `DescribeAvailabilityZones`\. In these authorized cases, you can add a suffixed wildcard to the common prefix\. For example, `ec2:Describe*`\.

This control passes if you use a prefixed IAM action with a suffixed wildcard\. For example, the following statement in a policy results in a passed finding\.

```
"Statement": [
{
  "Sid": "EC2-Wildcard",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "ec2:Describe*",
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

When you group related IAM actions in this way, you can also avoid exceeding the IAM policy size limits\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in the following Regions:  
Asia Pacific \(Osaka\)
China \(Beijing\)
China \(Ningxia\)
AWS GovCloud \(US\-East\)
AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\)

### Remediation<a name="iam-21-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, update your IAM policies so that they do not allow full "\*" administrative privileges\.

For details on how to edit an IAM policy, see [Editing IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-edit.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

## \[KMS\.1\] IAM customer managed policies should not allow decryption actions on all KMS keys<a name="fsbp-kms-1"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Secure access management

**Severity:** Medium

**Resource type:** `AWS::IAM::Policy`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-customer-policy-blocked-kms-actions.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-customer-policy-blocked-kms-actions.html)

**Parameters:** 
+ `kms:ReEncryptFrom, kms:Decrypt`

Checks whether the default version of IAM customer managed policies allow principals to use the AWS KMS decryption actions on all resources\. This control uses [Zelkova](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/protect-sensitive-data-in-the-cloud-with-automated-reasoning-zelkova/), an automated reasoning engine, to validate and warn you about policies that may grant broad access to your secrets across AWS accounts\.

This control fails, and flags the policy as `FAILED`, if the policy is open enough to allow `kms:Decrypt` or `kms:ReEncryptFrom` actions on any arbitrary KMS key\.

The control evaluates both attached and unattached customer managed policies\. It does not check inline policies or AWS managed policies\.

With AWS KMS, you control who can use your KMS keys and gain access to your encrypted data\. IAM policies define which actions an identity \(user, group, or role\) can perform on which resources\. Following security best practices, AWS recommends that you allow least privilege\. In other words, you should grant to identities only the `kms:Decrypt` or `kms:ReEncryptFrom` permissions and only for the keys that are required to perform a task\. Otherwise, the user might use keys that are not appropriate for your data\.

Instead of granting permissions for all keys, determine the minimum set of keys that users need to access encrypted data\. Then design policies that allow users to use only those keys\. For example, do not allow `kms:Decrypt` permission on all KMS keys\. Instead, allow `kms:Decrypt` only on keys in a particular Region for your account\. By adopting the principle of least privilege, you can reduce the risk of unintended disclosure of your data\.

### Remediation<a name="kms-1-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, you modify the IAM customer managed policies to restrict access to the keys\.

**To modify an IAM customer managed policy**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the IAM navigation pane, choose **Policies**\.

1. Choose the arrow next to the policy you want to modify\.

1. Choose **Edit policy**\.

1. Choose the **JSON** tab\.

1. Change the `“Resource”` value to the specific key or keys that you want to allow\.

1. After you modify the policy, choose **Review policy**\.

1. Choose **Save changes**\.

Instead of granting permission for all keys, determine the minimum set of keys that users need to access encrypted data\. Then design policies that allow the users to use only those keys\. For example, do not allow `kms:Decrypt` permission on all KMS keys\. Instead, allow the permission only on specific keys in a specific Region for your account\. By adopting the principle of least privilege, you can reduce the risk of unintended disclosure of your data\.

### Remediation<a name="kms-2-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, you modify the inline policy to restrict access to the keys\.

**To modify an IAM inline policy**

1. In the IAM navigation pane, choose **Users**, **Groups**, or **Roles**\. 

1. Choose the name of the user, group or role for which to modify IAM inline policies\. 

1. Choose the arrow next to the policy to modify\.

1. Choose **Edit policy**\.

1. Choose the **JSON** tab\.

1. Change the `"Resource"` value to the specific keys you want to allow\.

1. After you modify the policy, choose **Review policy**\.

1. Choose **Save changes**\.

## \[KMS\.3\] AWS KMS keys should not be unintentionally deleted<a name="fsbp-kms-3"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Data protection > Data deletion protection

**Severity:** Critical

**Resource type:** `AWS::KMS::Key`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/kms-cmk-not-scheduled-for-deletion.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/kms-cmk-not-scheduled-for-deletion.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether KMS keys are scheduled for deletion\. The control fails if a KMS key is scheduled for deletion\.

KMS keys cannot be recovered once deleted\. Data encrypted under a KMS key is also permanently unrecoverable if the KMS key is deleted\. If meaningful data has been encrypted under a KMS key scheduled for deletion, consider decrypting the data or re\-encrypting the data under a new KMS key unless you are intentionally performing a *cryptographic erasure*\.

When a KMS key is scheduled for deletion, a mandatory waiting period is enforced to allow time to reverse the deletion, if it was scheduled in error\. The default waiting period is 30 days, but it can be reduced to as short as 7 days when the KMS key is scheduled for deletion\. During the waiting period, the scheduled deletion can be canceled and the KMS key will not be deleted\.

For additional information regarding deleting KMS keys, see [Deleting KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in the Asia Pacific \(Osaka\) and Europe \(Milan\) Regions\.

### Remediation<a name="kms-3-remediation"></a>

For detailed remediation instructions to cancel a scheduled KMS key deletion, see **To cancel key deletion** under [Scheduling and canceling key deletion \(console\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html#deleting-keys-scheduling-key-deletion) in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide\. 

## \[Lambda\.1\] Lambda function policies should prohibit public access<a name="fsbp-lambda-1"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Secure network configuration

**Severity:** Critical

**Resource type:** `AWS::Lambda::Function`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/lambda-function-public-access-prohibited.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/lambda-function-public-access-prohibited.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether the Lambda function resource\-based policy prohibits public access outside of your account\.

The control also fails if a Lambda function is invoked from Amazon S3 and the policy does not include a condition for `AWS:SourceAccount`\.

The Lambda function should not be publicly accessible, as this may allow unintended access to your code stored in the function\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in the China \(Beijing\) or China \(Ningxia\) Regions\.

### Remediation<a name="lambda-1-remediation"></a>

If a Lambda function fails this control, it indicates that the resource\-based policy statement for the Lambda function allows public access\.

To remediate the issue, you must update the policy to remove the permissions or to add the `AWS:SourceAccount` condition\. You can only update the resource\-based policy from the Lambda API\.

The following instructions use the console to review the policy and the AWS Command Line Interface to remove the permissions\.

**To view the resource\-based policy for a Lambda function**

1. Open the AWS Lambda console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/lambda/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Functions**\.

1. Choose the function\.

1. Choose **Permissions**\. The resource\-based policy shows the permissions that are applied when another account or AWS service attempts to access the function\. 

1. Examine the resource\-based policy\. Identify the policy statement that has `Principal` field values that make the policy public\. For example, allowing `"*"` or `{ "AWS": "*" }`\.

   You cannot edit the policy from the console\. To remove permissions from the function, you use the `remove-permission` command from the AWS CLI\.

   Note the value of the statement ID \(`Sid`\) for the statement that you want to remove\.

To use the AWS CLI to remove permissions from a Lambda function, issue the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/remove-permission.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/remove-permission.html) command\.

```
$ aws lambda remove-permission --function-name <function-name> --statement-id <statement-id>
```

Replace `<function-name>` with the name of the Lambda function, and `<statement-id>` with the statement ID of the statement to remove\.

**To verify that the permissions are updated**

1. Open the AWS Lambda console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/lambda/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Functions**\.

1. Choose the function that you updated\.

1. Choose **Permissions**\.

   The resource\-based policy should be updated\. If there was only one statement in the policy, then the policy is empty\.

For more information, see [Using resource\-based policies for AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-resource-based.html) in the *AWS Lambda Developer Guide*\.

## \[Lambda\.2\] Lambda functions should use supported runtimes<a name="fsbp-lambda-2"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Secure development

**Severity:** Medium

**Resource type:** `AWS::Lambda::Function`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/lambda-function-settings-check.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/lambda-function-settings-check.html)

**Parameters:** 
+ `runtime`: `nodejs14.x, nodejs12.x, python3.9, python3.8, python3.7, python3.6, ruby2.7, java11, java8, java8.al2, go1.x, dotnetcore3.1`

This control checks that the Lambda function settings for runtimes match the expected values set for the supported runtimes for each language\. This control checks for the following runtimes: `nodejs14.x`, `nodejs12.x`, `python3.9`, `python3.8`, `python3.7`, `python3.6`, `ruby2.7`, `java11`, `java8`, `java8.al2`, `go1.x`, `dotnetcore3.1`

The AWS Config rule ignores functions that have a package type of `Image`\.

[Lambda runtimes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html) are built around a combination of operating system, programming language, and software libraries that are subject to maintenance and security updates\. When a runtime component is no longer supported for security updates, Lambda deprecates the runtime\. Even though you cannot create functions that use the deprecated runtime, the function is still available to process invocation events\. Make sure that your Lambda functions are current and do not use out\-of\-date runtime environments\.

To learn more about the supported runtimes that this control checks for the supported languages, see [AWS Lambda runtimes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html) in the *AWS Lambda Developer Guide*\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in the China \(Beijing\) or China \(Ningxia\) Regions\.

### Remediation<a name="lambda-2-remediation"></a>

For more information on supported runtimes and deprecation schedules, see the [Runtime support policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtime-support-policy.html) section of the *AWS Lambda Developer Guide*\. When you migrate your runtimes to the latest version, follow the syntax and guidance from the publishers of the language\.

## \[Lambda\.4\] Lambda functions should have a dead\-letter queue configured \(Retired\)<a name="fsbp-lambda-4"></a>

This control is retired\.

## \[RDS\.1\] RDS snapshots should be private<a name="fsbp-rds-1"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Secure network configuration

**Severity:** Critical

**Resource type:** `AWS::RDS::DBSnapshot`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/rds-snapshots-public-prohibited.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/rds-snapshots-public-prohibited.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether Amazon RDS snapshots are public\.

This control is intended for RDS instances\. It can also return findings for snapshots of Aurora DB instances, Neptune DB instances, and Amazon DocumentDB clusters, even though they are not evaluated for public accessibility\. If these findings are not useful, you can suppress them\.

RDS snapshots are used to back up the data on your RDS instances at a specific point in time\. They can be used to restore previous states of RDS instances\.

An RDS snapshot must not be public unless intended\. If you share an unencrypted manual snapshot as public, this makes the snapshot available to all AWS accounts\. This may result in unintended data exposure of your RDS instance\.

Note that if the configuration is changed to allow public access, the AWS Config rule may not be able to detect the change for up to 12 hours\. Until the AWS Config rule detects the change, the check passes even though the configuration violates the rule\.

To learn more about sharing a DB snapshot, see [Sharing a DB snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ShareSnapshot.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in Africa \(Cape Town\) or Europe \(Milan\)\.

### Remediation<a name="rds-1-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, update your RDS snapshots to remove public access\.

**To remove public access for RDS snapshots**

1. Open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. Navigate to **Snapshots** and then choose the public snapshot you want to modify\.

1. From **Actions**, choose **Share Snapshots**\.

1. From **DB snapshot visibility**, choose **Private**\.

1. Under **DB snapshot visibility**, choose **all**\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

## \[RDS\.2\] RDS DB instances should prohibit public access, determined by the PubliclyAccessible configuration<a name="fsbp-rds-2"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Secure network configuration

**Severity:** Critical

**Resource type:** `AWS::RDS::DBInstance`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/rds-instance-public-access-check.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/rds-instance-public-access-check.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether Amazon RDS instances are publicly accessible by evaluating the `PubliclyAccessible` field in the instance configuration item\.

Neptune DB instances and Amazon DocumentDB clusters do not have the `PubliclyAccessible` flag and cannot be evaluated\. However, this control can still generate findings for these resources\. You can suppress these findings\.

The `PubliclyAccessible` value in the RDS instance configuration indicates whether the DB instance is publicly accessible\. When the DB instance is configured with `PubliclyAccessible`, it is an Internet\-facing instance with a publicly resolvable DNS name, which resolves to a public IP address\. When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address\.

Unless you intend for your RDS instance to be publicly accessible, the RDS instance should not be configured with `PubliclyAccessible` value\. Doing so might allow unnecessary traffic to your database instance\.

### Remediation<a name="rds-2-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, update your RDS DB instances to remove public access\.

**To remove public access from RDS DB instances**

1. Open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. Navigate to **Databases** and then choose your public database\.

1. Choose **Modify**\.

1. Under **Connectivity**, expand **Additional connectivity configuration**\.

1. Under **Public access**, choose **Not publicly accessible**\.

1. Choose **Continue**\.

1. Under **Scheduling of modifications**, choose **Apply immediately**\.

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/rds-storage-encrypted.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/rds-storage-encrypted.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether storage encryption is enabled for your Amazon RDS DB instances\.

This control is intended for RDS DB instances\. However, it can also generate findings for Aurora DB instances, Neptune DB instances, and Amazon DocumentDB clusters\. If these findings are not useful, then you can suppress them\.

For an added layer of security for your sensitive data in RDS DB instances, you should configure your RDS DB instances to be encrypted at rest\. To encrypt your RDS DB instances and snapshots at rest, enable the encryption option for your RDS DB instances\. Data that is encrypted at rest includes the underlying storage for DB instances, its automated backups, read replicas, and snapshots\. 

RDS encrypted DB instances use the open standard AES\-256 encryption algorithm to encrypt your data on the server that hosts your RDS DB instances\. After your data is encrypted, Amazon RDS handles authentication of access and decryption of your data transparently with a minimal impact on performance\. You do not need to modify your database client applications to use encryption\. 

Amazon RDS encryption is currently available for all database engines and storage types\. Amazon RDS encryption is available for most DB instance classes\. To learn about DB instance classes that do not support Amazon RDS encryption, see [Encrypting Amazon RDS resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*\.

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether enhanced monitoring is enabled for your RDS DB instances\.

In Amazon RDS, Enhanced Monitoring enables a more rapid response to performance changes in underlying infrastructure\. These performance changes could result in a lack of availability of the data\. Enhanced Monitoring provides real\-time metrics of the operating system that your RDS DB instance runs on\. An agent is installed on the instance\. The agent can obtain metrics more accurately than is possible from the hypervisor layer\.

Enhanced Monitoring metrics are useful when you want to see how different processes or threads on a DB instance use the CPU\. For more information, see [Enhanced Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*\.

**AWS Config** rule: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-bucket-blacklisted-actions-prohibited.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-bucket-blacklisted-actions-prohibited.html)

**Parameters:**
+ `blacklistedactionpatterns`: `s3:DeleteBucketPolicy, s3:PutBucketAcl, s3:PutBucketPolicy, s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration, s3:PutObjectAcl`

This control checks whether the S3 bucket policy prevents principals from other AWS accounts from performing denied actions on resources in the S3 bucket\. The control fails if the S3 bucket policy allows any of the following actions for a principal in another AWS account:
+ `s3:DeleteBucketPolicy`
+ `s3:PutBucketAcl`
+ `s3:PutBucketPolicy`
+ `s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration`
+ `s3:PutObjectAcl`

Implementing least privilege access is fundamental to reducing security risk and the impact of errors or malicious intent\. If an S3 bucket policy allows access from external accounts, it could result in data exfiltration by an insider threat or an attacker\.

The `blacklistedactionpatterns` parameter allows for successful evaluation of the rule for S3 buckets\. The parameter grants access to external accounts for action patterns that are not included in the `blacklistedactionpatterns` list\.

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether your secrets have been accessed within a specified number of days\. The default value is 90 days\. If a secret was not accessed within the defined number of days, this control fails\.

Deleting unused secrets is as important as rotating secrets\. Unused secrets can be abused by their former users, who no longer need access to these secrets\. Also, as more users get access to a secret, someone might have mishandled and leaked it to an unauthorized entity, which increases the risk of abuse\. Deleting unused secrets helps revoke secret access from users who no longer need it\. It also helps to reduce the cost of using Secrets Manager\. Therefore, it is essential to routinely delete unused secrets\.

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/secretsmanager-secret-periodic-rotation.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/secretsmanager-secret-periodic-rotation.html)

**Parameters:**
+ **Rotation period:** 90 days by default

This control checks whether your secrets have been rotated at least once within 90 days\.

Rotating secrets can help you to reduce the risk of an unauthorized use of your secrets in your AWS account\. Examples include database credentials, passwords, third\-party API keys, and even arbitrary text\. If you do not change your secrets for a long period of time, the secrets are more likely to be compromised\.

As more users get access to a secret, it can become more likely that someone mishandled and leaked it to an unauthorized entity\. Secrets can be leaked through logs and cache data\. They can be shared for debugging purposes and not changed or revoked once the debugging completes\. For all these reasons, secrets should be rotated frequently\.

You can configure your secrets for automatic rotation in AWS Secrets Manager\. With automatic rotation, you can replace long\-term secrets with short\-term ones, significantly reducing the risk of compromise\.

Security Hub recommends that you enable rotation for your Secrets Manager secrets\. To learn more about rotation, see [Rotating your AWS Secrets Manager secrets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets.html) in the *AWS Secrets Manager User Guide*\.

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ec2-managedinstance-association-compliance-status-check.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ec2-managedinstance-association-compliance-status-check.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether the status of the AWS Systems Manager association compliance is `COMPLIANT` or `NON_COMPLIANT` after the association is run on an instance\. The control passes if the association compliance status is `COMPLIANT`\.

A State Manager association is a configuration that is assigned to your managed instances\. The configuration defines the state that you want to maintain on your instances\. For example, an association can specify that antivirus software must be installed and running on your instances or that certain ports must be closed\. 

After you create one or more State Manager associations, compliance status information is immediately available to you\. You can view the compliance status in the console or in response to AWS CLI commands or corresponding Systems Manager API actions\. For associations, Configuration Compliance shows the compliance status \(`Compliant` or `Non-compliant`\)\. It also shows the severity level assigned to the association, such as `Critical` or `Medium`\.

To learn more about State Manager association compliance, see [About State Manager association compliance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-compliance-about.html#sysman-compliance-about-association) in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide*\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in Africa \(Cape Town\) or Europe \(Milan\)\.

### Remediation<a name="ssm-3-remediation"></a>

A failed association can be related to different things, including targets and SSM document names\. To remediate this issue, you must first identify and investigate the association\. You can then update the association to correct the specific issue\.

You can edit an association to specify a new name, schedule, severity level, or targets\. After you edit an association, AWS Systems Manager creates a new version\.

**To investigate and update a failed association**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, under **Node Management**, choose **Fleet Manager**\.

1. Choose the instance ID that has an **Association status** of **Failed**\.

1. Choose **View details**\.

1. Choose **Associations**\.

1. Note the name of the association that has an **Association status** of **Failed**\. This is the association that you need to investigate\. You need to use the association name in the next step\.

1. In the navigation pane, under **Node Management**, choose **State Manager**\. Search for the association name, then select the association\.

1. After you determine the issue, edit the failed association to correct the problem\. For information on how to edit an association, see [Edit an association](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-state-assoc-edit.html)\.

For more information on creating and editing State Manager associations, see [Working with associations in Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-associations.html) in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide*\.

## \[SSM\.4\] SSM documents should not be public<a name="fsbp-ssm-4"></a>

**Category:** Protect > Secure network configuration > Resources not publicly accessible

**Severity:** Critical
