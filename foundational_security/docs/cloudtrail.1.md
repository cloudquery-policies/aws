## \[CloudTrail\.1\] CloudTrail should be enabled and configured with at least one multi\-Region trail

**Category:** Identify > Logging

**Severity:** High

**Resource type:** AWS account

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/multi-region-cloudtrail-enabled.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/multi-region-cloudtrail-enabled.html)

**Parameters:**
+ `readWriteType`: `ALL`

This control checks that there is at least one multi\-Region CloudTrail trail\.

AWS CloudTrail records AWS API calls for your account and delivers log files to you\. The recorded information includes the following information\.
+ Identity of the API caller
+ Time of the API call
+ Source IP address of the API caller
+ Request parameters
+ Response elements returned by the AWS service

CloudTrail provides a history of AWS API calls for an account, including API calls made from the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools\. The history also includes API calls from higher\-level AWS services such as AWS CloudFormation\.

The AWS API call history produced by CloudTrail enables security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing\. Multi\-Region trails also provide the following benefits\.
+ A multi\-Region trail helps to detect unexpected activity occurring in otherwise unused Regions\.
+ A multi\-Region trail ensures that global service event logging is enabled for a trail by default\. Global service event logging records events generated by AWS global services\.
+ For a multi\-Region trail, management events for all read and write operations ensure that CloudTrail records management operations on all of an AWS accountâ€™s resources\.

By default, CloudTrail trails that are created using the AWS Management Console are multi\-Region trails\.
