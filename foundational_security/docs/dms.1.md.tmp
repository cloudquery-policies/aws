**Category:** Protect > Secure network configuration

**Severity:** Critical

**Resource type:** `AWS::DMS::ReplicationInstance`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/dms-replication-not-public.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/dms-replication-not-public.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether AWS DMS replication instances are public\. To do this, it examines the value of the `PubliclyAccessible` field\.

A private replication instance has a private IP address that you cannot access outside of the replication network\. A replication instance should have a private IP address when the source and target databases are in the same network\. The network must also be connected to the replication instance's VPC using a VPN, AWS Direct Connect, or VPC peering\. To learn more about public and private replication instances, see [Public and private replication instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_ReplicationInstance.html#CHAP_ReplicationInstance.PublicPrivate) in the *AWS Database Migration Service User Guide*\.

You should also ensure that access to your AWS DMS instance configuration is limited to only authorized users\. To do this, restrict usersâ€™ IAM permissions to modify AWS DMS settings and resources\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in Africa \(Cape Town\) or Europe \(Milan\)\.
