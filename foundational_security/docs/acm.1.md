### Remediation<a name="acm-1-remediation"></a>

ACM provides managed renewal for your Amazon\-issued SSL/TLS certificates\. This means that ACM either renews your certificates automatically \(if you use DNS validation\), or it sends you email notices when the certificate expiration approaches\. These services are provided for both public and private ACM certificates\.

**For domains validated by email**  
When a certificate is 45 days from expiration, ACM sends to the domain owner an email for each domain name\. To validate the domains and complete the renewal, you must respond to the email notifications\.  
For more information, see [Renewal for domains validated by email](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/email-renewal-validation.html) in the *AWS Certificate Manager User Guide*\.

**For domains validated by DNS**  
ACM automatically renews certificates that use DNS validation\. 60 days before the expiration, ACM verifies that the certificate can be renewed\.  
If it cannot validate a domain name, then ACM sends a notification that manual validation is required\. It sends these notifications 45 days, 30 days, 7 days, and 1 day before the expiration\.  
For more information, see [Renewal for domains validated by DNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/dns-renewal-validation.html) in the *AWS Certificate Manager User Guide*\.
