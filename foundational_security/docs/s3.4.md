## \[S3\.4\] S3 buckets should have server\-side encryption enabled

**Category:** Protect > Data protection > Encryption of data at rest

**Severity:** Medium

**Resource type:** `AWS::S3::Bucket`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled.html)

**Parameters:** None

This control checks that your S3 bucket either has Amazon S3 default encryption enabled or that the S3 bucket policy explicitly denies put\-object requests without server\-side encryption\.

For an added layer of security for your sensitive data in S3 buckets, you should configure your buckets with server\-side encryption to protect your data at rest\. Amazon S3 encrypts each object with a unique key\. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it rotates regularly\. Amazon S3 server\-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available to encrypt your data, 256\-bit Advanced Encryption Standard \(AES\-256\)\.

To learn more, see [Protecting data using server\-side encryption with Amazon S3\-managed encryption keys \(SSE\-S3\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide*\.

### Remediation<a name="s3-4-remediation"></a>

To remediate this issue, update your S3 bucket to enable default encryption\.

**To enable default encryption on an S3 bucket**

1. Open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Buckets**\.

1. Choose the S3 bucket from the list\.

1. Choose **Properties**\.

1. Choose **Default encryption**\.

1. For the encryption, choose either **AES\-256** or **AWS\-KMS**\.
   + Choose **AES\-256** to use keys that are managed by Amazon S3 for default encryption\. For more information about using Amazon S3 server\-side encryption to encrypt your data, see the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html)\.
   + Choose **AWS\-KMS** to use keys that are managed by AWS KMS for default encryption\. Then choose a master key from the list of the AWS KMS master keys that you have created\.

     Type the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the AWS KMS key to use\. You can find the ARN for your AWS KMS key in the IAM console, under **Encryption keys**\. Or, you can choose a key name from the drop\-down list\.
**Important**  
If you use the AWS KMS option for your default encryption configuration, you are subject to the RPS \(requests per second\) quotas of AWS KMS\. For more information about AWS KMS quotas and how to request a quota increase, see the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/limits.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/limits.html)\.

     For more information about creating an AWS KMS key, see the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html)\.

     For more information about using AWS KMS with Amazon S3, see the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html)\.

   When enabling default encryption, you might need to update your bucket policy\. For more information about moving from bucket policies to default encryption, see the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html#bucket-encryption-update-bucket-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html#bucket-encryption-update-bucket-policy)\.

1. Choose **Save**\.
