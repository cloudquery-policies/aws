## \[S3\.6\] Amazon S3 permissions granted to other AWS accounts in bucket policies should be restricted

**Category:** Protect > Secure access management > Sensitive API operations actions restricted 

**Severity:** High

**Resource type:** `AWS::S3::Bucket`

**AWS Config** rule: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-bucket-blacklisted-actions-prohibited.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-bucket-blacklisted-actions-prohibited.html)

**Parameters:**
+ `blacklistedactionpatterns`: `s3:DeleteBucketPolicy, s3:PutBucketAcl, s3:PutBucketPolicy, s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration, s3:PutObjectAcl`

This control checks whether the S3 bucket policy prevents principals from other AWS accounts from performing denied actions on resources in the S3 bucket\. The control fails if the S3 bucket policy allows any of the following actions for a principal in another AWS account:
+ `s3:DeleteBucketPolicy`
+ `s3:PutBucketAcl`
+ `s3:PutBucketPolicy`
+ `s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration`
+ `s3:PutObjectAcl`

Implementing least privilege access is fundamental to reducing security risk and the impact of errors or malicious intent\. If an S3 bucket policy allows access from external accounts, it could result in data exfiltration by an insider threat or an attacker\.

The `blacklistedactionpatterns` parameter allows for successful evaluation of the rule for S3 buckets\. The parameter grants access to external accounts for action patterns that are not included in the `blacklistedactionpatterns` list\.
