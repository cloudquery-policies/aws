**Parameters:** None

This control checks whether RDS DB clusters are configured to copy all tags to snapshots when the snapshots are created\.

Identification and inventory of your IT assets is a crucial aspect of governance and security\. You need to have visibility of all your RDS DB clusters so that you can assess their security posture and take action on potential areas of weakness\. Snapshots should be tagged in the same way as their parent RDS database clusters\. Enabling this setting ensures that snapshots inherit the tags of their parent database clusters\.

**Note**  
This control is not supported in the following Regions:  
China \(Beijing\)
Middle East \(Bahrain\)
South America \(SÃ£o Paulo\)
