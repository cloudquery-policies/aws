**Category:** Protect > Protective services

**Severity:** Medium

**Resource type:** `AWS::CloudFront::Distribution`

**AWS Config rule:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/cloudfront-associated-with-waf.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/cloudfront-associated-with-waf.html)

**Parameters:**
+ `wafWebAclIds` \(Optional\) \- A comma\-separated list of web ACL IDs \(for AWS WAF\) or web ACL ARNs \(for AWS WAFv2\)\.

This control checks whether CloudFront distributions are associated with either AWS WAF or AWS WAFv2 web ACLs\. The control fails if the distribution is not associated with a web ACL\.

AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect web applications and APIs from attacks\. It allows you to configure a set of rules, called a web access control list \(web ACL\), that allow, block, or count web requests based on customizable web security rules and conditions that you define\. Ensure your CloudFront distribution is associated with an AWS WAF web ACL to help protect it from malicious attacks\.
