# AWS CIS 1.14 Ensure hardware MFA is enabled for the 'root' account (Scored)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 2

## Description

The root account is the most privileged user in an AWS account. MFA adds an extra layer of
protection on top of a user name and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to
an AWS website, they will be prompted for their user name and password as well as for an
authentication code from their AWS MFA device. For Level 2, it is recommended that the
root account be protected with a hardware MFA.

## Rationale

A hardware MFA has a smaller attack surface than a virtual MFA. For example, a hardware
MFA does not suffer the attack surface introduced by the mobile smartphone on which a
virtual MFA resides.
Note: Using hardware MFA for many, many AWS accounts may create a logistical device
management issue. If this is the case, consider implementing this Level 2 recommendation
selectively to the highest security AWS accounts and the Level 1 recommendation applied
to the remaining accounts.
