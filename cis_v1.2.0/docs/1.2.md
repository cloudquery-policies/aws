# AWS CIS 1.2 Ensure MFA is enabled for all IAM users that have a console password (Scored)

## Description

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection on top of a user name
and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS website, they will be
prompted for their user name and password as well as for an authentication code from
their AWS MFA device. It is recommended that MFA be enabled for all accounts that have a
console password.

## Rationale

Enabling MFA provides increased security for console access as it requires the
authenticating principal to possess a device that emits a time-sensitive key and have
knowledge of a credential.
