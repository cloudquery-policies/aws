# AWS CIS 2.9 Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all VPCs (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 2

## Description

VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. After you've created a flow log, you can view and retrieve its data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. It is recommended that VPC Flow Logs be enabled for packet "Rejects" for VPCs.

## Rationale

VPC Flow Logs provide visibility into network traffic that traverses the VPC and can be used to detect anomalous traffic or insight during security workflows.

## Notes:

Changed title from

"Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all applicable regions"

to

"Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all VPCs"
For these reasons:

1. Flow logs cannot be enabled for regions, only for VPCs
2. The statement did not define an "Applicable Region" and did not clarify "all VPCs in
applicable regions"
3. All other benchmark recommendations appear to assume that you apply them "any actively used configuration or resource" or "All resources" - so specifying "applicable" to mean "active" or "compliant with the benchmark" seems unnecessary.
