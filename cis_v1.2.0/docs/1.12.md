# AWS CIS 1.12  Ensure no root account access key exists (Scored)

## Description

The root account is the most privileged user in an AWS account. AWS Access Keys provide
programmatic access to a given AWS account. It is recommended that all access keys
associated with the root account be removed.

## Rationale

Removing access keys associated with the root account limits vectors by which the account
can be compromised. Additionally, removing the root access keys encourages the creation
and use of role based accounts that are least privileged.
