# AWS CIS 3.2 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for Management Console sign-in without MFA (Scored)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description:

Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for console logins that are not protected by multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## Rationale:

Monitoring for single-factor console logins will increase visibility into accounts that are not protected by MFA.

## Notes:

Configuring log metric filter and alarm on Multi-region (global) CloudTrail
- ensures that activities from all regions (used as well as unused) are monitored
- ensures that activities on all supported global services are monitored
- ensures that all management events across all regions are monitored
