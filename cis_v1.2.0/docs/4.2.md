# AWS CIS 4.2 Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389 (Scored)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description:

Security groups provide stateful filtering of ingress/egress network traffic to AWS resources. It is recommended that no security group allows unrestricted ingress access to port 3389 .

## Rationale:

Removing unfettered connectivity to remote console services, such as RDP, reduces a server's exposure to risk.

## Impact:

For updating an existing environment, care should be taken to ensure that administrators currently relying on an existing ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 have access to ports 22 and/or 3389 through another security group.
