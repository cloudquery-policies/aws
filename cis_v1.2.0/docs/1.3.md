# AWS CIS 1.3 Ensure credentials unused for 90 days or greater are disabled (Scored)

## Description

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection on top of a user name
and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS website, they will be
prompted for their user name and password as well as for an authentication code from
their AWS MFA device. It is recommended that MFA be enabled for all accounts that have a
console password.

## Rationale

Disabling or removing unnecessary credentials will reduce the window of opportunity for
credentials associated with a compromised or abandoned account to be used.
