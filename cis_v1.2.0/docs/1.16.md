# AWS CIS 1.16 Ensure IAM policies are attached only to groups or roles (Scored)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

By default, IAM users, groups, and roles have no access to AWS resources. IAM policies are
the means by which privileges are granted to users, groups, or roles. It is recommended
that IAM policies be applied directly to groups and roles but not users.

## Rationale

Assigning privileges at the group or role level reduces the complexity of access management as the number of users grow. Reducing access management complexity may in-turn reduce opportunity for a principal to inadvertently receive or retain excessive privileges.
