# AWS CIS 3.1 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for unauthorized API calls (Scored)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description:

Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for unauthorized API calls.

## Rationale:

Monitoring unauthorized API calls will help reveal application errors and may reduce time
to detect malicious activity.

## Impact:

This alert may be triggered by normal read-only console activities that attempt to opportunistically gather optional information, but gracefully fail if they don't have permissions.

If an excessive number of alerts are being generated then an organization may wish to consider adding read access to the limited IAM user permissions simply to quiet the alerts.

In some cases doing this may allow the users to actually view some areas of the system - any additional access given should be reviewed for alignment with the original limited IAM user intent.
