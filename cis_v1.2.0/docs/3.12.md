# AWS CIS 3.12 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for changes to network gateways (Scored)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. Network gateways are required to send/receive traffic to a destination outside of a VPC. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes to network gateways.

## Rationale

Monitoring changes to network gateways will help ensure that all ingress/egress traffic traverses the VPC border via a controlled path.

## Notes

Configuring log metric filter and alarm on Multi-region (global) CloudTrail
- ensures that activities from all regions (used as well as unused) are monitored
- ensures that activities on all supported global services are monitored
- ensures that all management events across all regions are monitored
