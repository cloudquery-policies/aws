# AWS CIS 3.5 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for CloudTrail configuration changes (Scored)

## Profile Applicability:

## Description

Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for detecting changes to CloudTrail's configurations.

## Rationale

Monitoring changes to CloudTrail's configuration will help ensure sustained visibility to activities performed in the AWS account.

- ensures that activities on all supported global services are monitored
- ensures that all management events across all regions are monitored
