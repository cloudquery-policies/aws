# AWS CIS 3.8 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for S3 bucket policy changes (Scored)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes to S3 bucket policies.

## Rationale

Monitoring changes to S3 bucket policies may reduce time to detect and correct permissive policies on sensitive S3 buckets.

## Notes

Configuring log metric filter and alarm on Multi-region (global) CloudTrail
- ensures that activities from all regions (used as well as unused) are monitored
- ensures that activities on all supported global services are monitored
- ensures that all management events across all regions are monitored
