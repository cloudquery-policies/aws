# AWS CIS 1.4 Ensure access keys are rotated every 90 days or less

## Description

Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign
programmatic requests that you make to AWS. AWS users need their own access keys to
make programmatic calls to AWS from the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), Tools
for Windows PowerShell, the AWS SDKs, or direct HTTP calls using the APIs for individual
AWS services. It is recommended that all access keys be regularly rotated.

## Rationale

Rotating access keys will reduce the window of opportunity for an access key that is
associated with a compromised or terminated account to be used.
Access keys should be rotated to ensure that data cannot be accessed with an old key which
might have been lost, cracked, or stolen.
