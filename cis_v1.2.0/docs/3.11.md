# AWS CIS 3.11 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for changes to Network Access Control Lists (NACL) (Scored)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 2

## Description

Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. NACLs are used as a stateless packet filter to control ingress and egress traffic for subnets within a VPC. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes made to NACLs.

## Rationale

Monitoring changes to NACLs will help ensure that AWS resources and services are not unintentionally exposed.

## Notes

Configuring log metric filter and alarm on Multi-region (global) CloudTrail
- ensures that activities from all regions (used as well as unused) are monitored
- ensures that activities on all supported global services are monitored
- ensures that all management events across all regions are monitored
