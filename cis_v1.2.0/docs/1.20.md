# AWS CIS 1.20 Ensure a support role has been created to manage incidents with AWS Support (Scored)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

AWS provides a support center that can be used for incident notification and response, as well as technical support and customer services. Create an IAM Role to allow authorized users to manage incidents with AWS Support.

## Rationale

By implementing least privilege for access control, an IAM Role will require an appropriate IAM Policy to allow Support Center Access in order to manage Incidents with AWS Support.

## Impact

All AWS Support plans include an unlimited number of account and billing support cases,
with no long-term contracts. Support billing calculations are performed on a per-account
basis for all plans. Enterprise Support plan customers have the option to include multiple
enabled accounts in an aggregated monthly billing calculation. Monthly charges for the
Business and Enterprise support plans are based on each month's AWS usage charges,
subject to a monthly minimum, billed in advance.
