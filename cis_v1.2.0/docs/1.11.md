# AWS CIS 1.11 Ensure IAM password policy expires passwords within 90 days or less

## Description

IAM password policies can require passwords to be rotated or expired after a given
number of days. It is recommended that the password policy expire passwords after 90
days or less.

## Rationale

Reducing the password lifetime increases account resiliency against brute force login
attempts. Additionally, requiring regular password changes help in the following scenarios:
 Passwords can be stolen or compromised sometimes without your knowledge. This
can happen via a system compromise, software vulnerability, or internal threat.
 Certain corporate and government web filters or proxy servers have the ability to
intercept and record traffic even if it's encrypted.
 Many people use the same password for many systems such as work, email, and
personal.
 Compromised end user workstations might have a keystroke logger
