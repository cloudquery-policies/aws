# AWS CIS 2.2 Ensure CloudTrail log file validation is enabled (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 2

## Description

CloudTrail log file validation creates a digitally  signed digest file containing a hash of each log that CloudTrail writes to S3. These digest files can be used to determine whether a log file was changed, deleted, or unchanged after CloudTrail delivered the log. It is recommended that file validation be enabled on all CloudTrails.

## Rationale

Enabling log file validation will provide additional integrity checking of CloudTrail logs.
