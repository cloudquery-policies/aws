# AWS CIS 3.13 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for route table changes (Scored)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description

Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. Routing tables are used to route network traffic between subnets and to network gateways. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be  established for changes to route tables.

## Rationale

Monitoring changes to route tables will help ensure that all VPC traffic flows through an expected path.

## Notes

Configuring log metric filter and alarm on Multi-region (global) CloudTrail
- ensures that activities from all regions (used as well as unused) are monitored
- ensures that activities on all supported global services are monitored
- ensures that all management events across all regions are monitored
