# AWS CIS 1.1 Avoid the use of 'root' account. Show used in last 30 days (Scored)

## Description

The "root" account has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS account. It is highly
recommended that the use of this account be avoided.

## Rationale

The "root" account is the most privileged AWS account. Minimizing the use of this account
and adopting the principle of least privilege for access management will reduce the risk of
accidental changes and unintended disclosure of highly privileged credentials.
