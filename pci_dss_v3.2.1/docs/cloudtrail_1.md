# CloudTrail logs should be encrypted at rest using AWS KMS keys

This control checks whether AWS CloudTrail is configured to use the server-side encryption (SSE) AWS KMS key encryption.

If you are only using the default encryption option, you can choose to disable this check.

## Related PCI DSS requirements

This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements:

**PCI DSS 3.4: Render Primary Account Numbers (PAN) unreadable anywhere it is stored (including on portable digital media, backup media, and in logs).**

> If you are using AWS services to process and store PAN, your CloudTrail logs should be encrypted at rest. Encrypting logs ensures that if logs capture PAN(s), the PAN(s) are protected.
>
> By default, the log files delivered by CloudTrail to your S3 bucket are encrypted using Amazon server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). See the [Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html).
>
> You can configure CloudTrail logs to leverage customer managed keys to further protect CloudTrail logs.
>
> These are methods used to render PAN unreadable.

## Remediation

To remediate this issue, you enable encryption for your CloudTrail log files.

For details on how to encrypt CloudTrail log files with AWS KMS managed keys (SSE-KMS), see [Encrypting CloudTrail log files with AWS KMSâ€“managed keys (SSE-KMS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/encrypting-cloudtrail-log-files-with-aws-kms.html) in the _AWS CloudTrail User Guide_.
